# Code explanation

We define the data_packet_t structure representing the data packet with fields for id, data_length, data, and crc. 
The calculateCRC function calculates the CRC value based on the packet data using a simple XOR-based CRC-16 algorithm.

In the main function, 
we simulate the transmission and reception of the data packet. 
First, the CRC is calculated and assigned to the crc field of the original packet.
Then, the original packet is transmitted and received (simulated here by assigning it to receivedPacket). 

The CRC is recalculated on the received packet, and the calculated CRC is compared with the received CRC. 
Based on the comparison, a message is printed indicating whether the packet is corrupted or not.
